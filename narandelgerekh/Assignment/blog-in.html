                    <p>
                        Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about
                        how
                        to get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a
                        Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a
                        set
                        of UX copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain,
                        casual to
                        playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post,
                        ‘Designing
                        voice and tone for error messages.
